Reference for writing clear PHP code 

It is difficult to know when one's code is well written. There are recommandations for writting PHP code in the manual, from CS theories, peers review and gut feeling. That makes a lot of rules. 

The main goal of this document is to collect such rules, so as to have them all easy to read and select them for reviewing one's code. This is a reference document, in which anyone may look for ways to improve their code.
